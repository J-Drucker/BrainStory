# BrainStory Core

A high-performance, modular neural dataflow engine for real-time and offline brain signal analysis. Built for speed, extensibility, and clarity.

### Key Features
- Rust-powered dataflow engine
- Node-based architecture for EEG, BCI, and biosignal workflows
- Real-time + batch modes
- Extensible node system
- GUI and scripting APIs (coming soon)

### Tech Stack
- Backend: Rust (PyO3 bindings planned)
- Frontend: Flutter or Web (WIP)
- Interop: LSL, JSON, WebSocket/gRPC

### Status
🚧 Under active development. Currently implementing:
- Core node engine
- Initial node types (e.g., Filter, FFT, Display)
